- μFuzzy [🛈](https://github.com/leeoniya/uFuzzy)
  - μFuzzy is a tiny, efficient, fuzzy search library designed to match a short search phrase against a large list of short-to-medium phrases. It can be used for list filtering, auto-complete, or title/name/description/filename/function searches. μFuzzy features straightforward fuzziness control, customized sorting, and a concise set of options.
